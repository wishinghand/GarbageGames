# Garbage Games
Two random words were given for our project theme. Ours were: `games` and `trash`. We have interpreted this to be: a CRUD app to help people rate absolute trash games

We didn't quite finish in the time allotted- too much was spent starting all of the little pieces that would eventually fit together instead of focusing on a feature and then completing it. We may revisit it at a later date.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
    + Materalize.css
    + SASS
- Javascript
    + Angular
    + jquery (for Materialize.css)
    + Gulp

## How to Run
Clone the repo, `cd` into the directory and run:
```
npm install
```

and then serve the frontend with this command:
```
gulp serve
```

Open a new tab on your terminal and run the backend with this:
```
node server.js
```
